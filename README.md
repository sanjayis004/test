## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides infrastructure and simple development experience for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It is built on top of Node.js and React, and it allows you to build fast and user-friendly web applications.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start coding with Next.js, you need to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Next.js requires Node.js. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm or Yarn**: These are package managers for JavaScript. npm comes with Node.js, but you can also use Yarn if you prefer.

### Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js from the official website. This will also install npm.

### Install a Code Editor

You can use any code editor, but Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is highly recommended for its features and extensions. Download it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Creating a New Next.js Project

Once your environment is set up, you can create a new Next.js project.

### Using Create Next App

Next.js provides a command-line tool to set up a new project quickly.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
```

Replace `my-nextjs-app` with the name of your project. This command will create a new Next.js project in a directory with the same name.

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-nextjs-app
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

A Next.js project has a specific structure. Here are the most important parts:

- `pages/`: Contains the pages of your application. Each file in this directory represents a route.
- `public/`: Static files like images, fonts, etc.
- `styles/`: CSS files for styling your application.
- `components/`: (Optional) A common directory to store your React components.

## Pages and Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Each file in the `pages/` directory automatically becomes a route.

### Creating a Page

Create a new file `about.js` in the `pages/` directory:

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>This is the about page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, if you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/about`, you will see the About page.

### Dynamic Routes

You can create dynamic routes using square brackets. For example, create `[id].js` in the `pages/` directory:

```jsx
// pages/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function Post() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Post: {id}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, if you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/1`, you will see "Post: 1".

## Styling in Next.js

Next.js supports various ways to style your application, including CSS, Sass, and CSS-in-JS solutions.

### Using CSS Modules

Create a CSS file in the `styles/` directory:

```css
/* styles/Home.module.css */
.container {
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Import and use the CSS module in your component:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
